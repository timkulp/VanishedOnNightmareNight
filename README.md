# VanishedOnNightmareNight
Nightmare Night is upon us and the place to be is Baltimare for the Nightmare Night Masquerade. Upon arriving at the party the ponies discover that a few of the attendees have disappeared. Before they disappeared, the attendees said they were going to the grave of the horror writer Edgar Allenpony. The host of the masquerade, Madam Morose, has asked you to find the missing party goers. Be warned, strange things happen at the grave of Mr. Allenpony on Nightmare Night. Some say it is haunted by the creatures of his stories, other say it is a doorway to the dream lands, whatever the case â€“ be ready for a night of mystery.
